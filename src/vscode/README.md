# TON for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds support for [TON](https://docs.vezel.dev/ton) to
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Features include syntax and
semantic highlighting, code snippets, code navigation, code completion, document
formatting, and more.

This extension can provide basic language features on its own, but the majority
of functionality requires the TON language server. To use the language server,
you must have the `ton` executable available in your `PATH`, or configure the
location manually with the `ton.executablePath` setting. See TON's
[installation instructions](https://docs.vezel.dev/TON/installation) for more
information.
